# TriviaGame

Challenges faced:

1.To display the next question,even after iterating through the questions.

solution: Made a function to show question area and to call the code increment question.

2.To set the time interval so that it automatically moves on to the next question.

solution: Had to combine it with hide content area function,as the question is hidden, it displays messge for 3 sec and the moves on to the next question.

3. Last question was getting displayed again after finishing the increment loop,had a tough time in Reseting the game.

Solution: Called the Restart function after the on click function which starts onclicking the start button.



Overall, a good learning experience.

Areas of improvement:

To set the timer function  30 sec to perfection, whenever we move on to the next question.
